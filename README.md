# moos-android

Java implementation of core MOOS functionality taken from Ben Davis's
MOOSBeans:
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mobile/MOOS/wiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JavaMOOS

The MOOSEventServer design used in MOOSBeans was abandoned in favor of
an implementation more similar to the CMOOSApp class.

As far as I've been able to tell, Android Studio and Gradle don't
provide a way to build a library outside of an application, thus the
moosbeans folder is symlinked into each project. Suggestions for
alternate project/build setup would be more than welcome.
